    "I'm excited to share the second version of my momentum model! I've been away from basketball analytics over the past eight months, but the time away has been filled with opportunities that have allow me to create an improved second version. To start, I'd like to say thanks to all the friends and mentors who gave me insights and ideas into how I could make this model more robust to capture other important features in winning. Moreover, I've had the chance to actually see the validity in my results given that I posted the first iteration back in April 2022 looking ahead towards the NBA post-season. Finally, I've had the opportunity to really improve in my Python skills thanks to opportunities I've had working at Uber this summer and in quantitative investment research and trading this fall. Graduating this semester made life quite hectic and I missed the chance to come back to this project before the NBA regular-season started, but I'm grateful to be able to revisit it now and show the second iteration.\n",

    "### Overview of Momentum Version 2 <a name=\"versiontwo\"></a>\n",
    "---\n",
    "At the end of the 2021-2022 NBA regular season I posted about a metric I had worked on called *momentum*. Momentum was my attempt to help quantify or capture the value of consistent good (bad) performances from a team over time. Obviously, there are traditional or more conventional ways of understanding which team is the \"best\" in the conference or across the league, but existing methods like record or conference ranking don't take into account more situational or contextual factors that I seek to capture with the momentum metric. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first iteration of this metric came in April 2022, with the goal of creating some quantification to represent a team's performance throughout the season. This first model revolved around three terms: the number of the game in the season, the team point differential for each game, and the number of consecutive wins or losses in a row at each game played. This metric can be decomposed into a game level calculation of momentum and a running sum of total momentum across a season, which is just the sum of each individual game level momentum. If interested, my paper on the first version can be found [here.](https://rpubs.com/kckrishn/nba_2021_2022_momentum_analysis) \n",
    "\n",
    "**Single Game Momentum (Marginal Momentum)**\n",
    "$$ m_g = \\left[ \\theta_g + \\left( \\Delta P_g  \\times \\omega_{opp,g} \\right) \\right] + \\left[ \\zeta_{g} \\times \\gamma (g) \\times \\lambda_{g} \\right] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total Momentum (Aggregate Momentum)**\n",
    "$$ M_{(1, \\space g)} = \\sum^{G}_{g = 1} m_g = \\sum^{G}_{g = 1} \\left[ \\theta_g + \\left( \\Delta P_g  \\times \\omega_{opp,g} \\right) \\right] + \\left[ \\zeta_{g} \\times \\gamma (g) \\times \\lambda_{g} \\right] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first version of the momentum model came to me after thinking about how my Cleveland Cavaliers were the second seed in the east at one point and sadly failed to make the final eight for the post-season. How could a team achieve such a peak, relatively deep into the season, but still walk away without anything to show for that height. It would be a stretch to say that conventional measures fail to explain their performance, but just saying the team lost more games than they won coming off of that peak doesn't tell the full story. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's what brought me to create a slightly more complex model compared to just the conference rankings, capturing wins and losses with added details focused on winning/losing streaks, margins of victory/defeat, and win/loss timing. These three aspects first jumped out to me as the elements of a game that might stick with a team after the fact. Now, in this second iteration I'm happy to be able to include a handful of additional, more complex, elements that provide greater detail on other important game aspects which have cascading impacts on a team into the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "I explain all the parameters in greater detail in their respective sections, so for the overview I provide a high-level understanding of what goes into Momentum Version 2 and a justification for why I think the new parameters are important. I decided to keep all the original model inputs but made adjustments to the parameters to better fit them within the bounds of this second iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "**$\\gamma (g) \\rightarrow$** is a dynamic time-varying parameter which adjusts as the season progresses to appropriately weight the value of a game. The dynamic weighting is important as my hypothesis is that wins at certain points in the season (i.e., the first handful of games and the final stretch of games) are the most important to defining a teams success. The middle of the season isn't a total wash but the game effects are less sticky during this part of the season on a team's ability to make a deep playoff push. \n",
    "\n",
    "**$\\zeta_g \\rightarrow$** is the parameter accounting for the win or loss streak. Originally, this value was only positive and represented the length of the streak at game $g$. Now, this parameter has direction and is meant to add to the positive (negative) effects of continued winning (losing). \n",
    "\n",
    "**$\\Delta P_g \\rightarrow$** represents the point differential. This is still the same parameter in concept, except the values have been scaled based on the aveage points per game for a team at game $g$ in the regular season. Scaling the value was important to balance out the impacts of all the different parameters. Common margins of victory could still be up to 10x greater than values of other parameters and therefore this would overweight the importance of the point spread. \n",
    "\n",
    "**$\\omega_{opp, \\space g} \\rightarrow$** This begins the addition of new parameters to the model. Omega is used to account for the strength of the opponent in game $g$. This parameter could take on two values, one for the game where a team wins a game and another in the case of a loss. In a winning scenario, the parameter positively with the winning percentage of the opponent. For losses, the parameter shrinks as an opponents winning percentage increases. The movement of the parameter is justified under the hypothesis that a win against a good team should have greater morale boost for a team. Similarly, a loss to a bad team could have a outsized detriment to a team's morale compared to playing a good team. \n",
    "\n",
    "**$\\theta_g \\rightarrow$** This parameter captures how well a team shot the three-ball in a given game $g$. I wanted to include a shooting parameter to the model since shooting has such a significant impact on player & team confidence. If a team shot the lights out and still lost the game, chances are they're not going to hesitate to shoot going forward. However, if a team shoots poorly and loses then it's a different story. Theta is included to provide more in-game details on a team's performance to better capture the details of the win or loss. I chose to measure the team's strength in shooting the three-ball instead of just their field goal percentage since the three-pointer is a key part of a high-powered offense in today's game and also has a powerful impact on a team's confidence. \n",
    "\n",
    "**$\\lambda_g \\rightarrow$** The final parameter is included to adjust for two special game outcomes: the road win and the home loss. Lambda is a simple parameter, taking on the value of 1 or 1.25. It assumes the latter in the case of a road win or a home loss, as I assume these two game outcomes to have a greater impact on a team's momentum. Road wins should have a greater boost given that a team has to travel to another arena and play in front of the opposing team's fans. In constrast, a home loss should have a more determintal impact on a team's momentum given that they're supposed to have the upper hand, get to play in front of their own fans, and don't have to travel at all for the game. Lambda only takes on positive values since it is multiplied to the $\\zeta_g$ parameter which accounts for the direction (i.e., wins versus losses). \n",
    "\n",
    "The model can be decomposed into two components, being the left and right term on the sides of the + sign. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ m_g = \\underbrace{\\left[ \\theta_g + \\left( \\Delta P_g  \\times \\omega_{opp,g} \\right) \\right]}_{\\textnormal{In-game Details}} + \\underbrace{\\left( \\zeta_{g} \\times \\gamma (g) \\times \\lambda_{g} \\right)}_{\\textnormal{Game Timing Details}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "I constructed the model as displayed above according to the following logic. I decided to split the model into two terms since there are multiple directional variables. In this model, both $\\Delta P_g$ and $\\zeta_g$ will be negative if a team loses a game. Multiplying both of these variables together would create positive momentum for the sitation which would not be correct. Therefore, splitting up the two terms allows for the inclusion of multiple directional variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "The left term of the equation is designed to account for more in-game details. I multiply the margin of victory (defeat) against the opponent strength parameter to adjust the margin according to how good (bad) the opposing team was. I then added this to the shooting parameter to potentially soften the blow of a loss in the event that a team shot well. A more general understanding would be that there are two in-game details that can stick with a team's momentum as they move forward into the season: the efficiency or quality of their offense and their offensive output, measured by $\\theta_g$ and $\\Delta P_g$ in this term. \n",
    "\n",
    "The right term of the equation captures more time dependent characteristecs of a the outcome of a given game. If a team is deep in a winning (losing) streak at an important (unimportant) part of the season, these factors should compound with one another to impact momentum. Additionally, if the team wins (loses) in a setting where they're not expected (expected) to have performed that well, then this should also compound with the situational factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Borrowing from the same example used in the first paper, I'll explain how this model works by using the Dallas Mavericks and their 112 to 105 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers from February 10th, 2022. Dallas won this game with a 7-point margin of victory, shooting 33% from the field making 13 three-pointers. The Clippers at this point had a winning percentage of 48.21%. This was Dallas's 56th game of the season and their fourth win in a row, beating the Clippers at home. If all these details are then put into the model, we see that this game had a marginal momentum impact of +36.17 for the Mavericks, making their aggregate momentum for the year at that point in time +583.76.

    "\n",
    "The million dollar question is then how does this model perform in comparison to the first model? It helps that the 2021-2022 NBA post-season has already concluded, as now we can retroactively evaluate the performance of the first version of momentum. \n",

    "A quick check of how the model performed compared to reality doesn't produce many surprises for the Eastern conference, but is a bit less consistent for the Western conference. In the East, the model had Boston as the unquestionable favorate to make it out of the conference, but in hindsight their path was a lot more difficult than suggested given their back-to-back 7-game series against Milwaukee and Miami. More minor errors show that Toronto had greater momentum than Philadelphia despite falling in a 6-game series to the 76ers. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the West, the model predicted Phoenix to dominate the conference. We all know how that turned out (lets go Luka), but their collapse in game seven of that series was unexpected to say the least. However, the model doesn't seem to think too highly of the Warriors, the eventual 2021-2022 NBA champions. It scores them accordingly with their 3rd-seed spot heading into the playoffs, but teams like the Timberwolves and the Mavericks have comparably high momentum. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the visualized results for how this model would've performed if applied to the 2021-2022 NBA regular season. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Eastern Conference Playoff Teams](ec_playoff_momentum.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The results for the Eastern Conference aren't too shocking, but they're a lot more inline with reality when compared to the original version. One of the bigger differences in these results is that while Boston is still the conference momentum leader, their advantage isn't as dominant as that produced in version one. In the case of Philidelphia and Toronto, the model still suggests that Toronto has a momentum advantage but the gap is much closer. The rest of the results follow the actual breakdown of Eastern Conference playoff play. If one was to extraplote on the results produced in this graph, it would be to go back and look at the amount of times two curves cross over to really study the advantage one team has over another. For example, at the end of the season Miami finished with a slight momentum advantage over Milwaukee. But, their two curves cross over a handful of times during the season which suggests they're much more similar than results might indicate. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Western Conference Playoff Teams](wc_playoff_momentum.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Western conference results are also closer to reality in this version compared to the prior. Phoenix's lead is still evident when compared to all other teams, but on paper there isn't anything too alarming to dispute their momentum advantage. This version of the model does a lot more justice to Golden State, leaving them with the 3rd highest momentum in the conference and just under Memphis who has the 2nd highest. Memphis comfortably held the 2nd seed in the conference, but Golden State took them down in a 6-game series in the Western Conference semi-final. Memphis was missing their star player (Ja Morant), but perhaps Golden State was a lot closer of a matchup than end of season standings might've suggested. This is a tough case to justify the model on, however, since Golden State is loaded with veteran talent and playoff experience, two of the most important roster characteristecs come the post-season. \n",
    "\n",
    "Version two doesn't inflate the performance of the Timberwolves anywhere near as high as did version 1. They're a good team and took two games off the Grizzlies, but they're not a top three team in the Western Conference for aggregate momentum. However, a team that punched above its weight in the playoffs but didn't score well in both iterations is the Pelicans. In both cases, they produce the lowest aggregate momentum out of all Western Conference teams, but still managed to take two games off the conference leader. "

    "### Fourier Analysis Applied to Smoothing Parameter Construction <a name=\"gamma\"></a>\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The first iteration of this model approached the value of wins and losses as increasing linearly. The original parameter $\\gamma$ increased by one for each game into the 82-game long NBA regular season. While simple, this approach was effective in capturing my original intention which was to show that wins and losses matter more to a team's momentum later on into the regular season than they do earlier. Nonetheless, this model might suffer from oversimplification under the assumption that holding all else equal, momentum should scale linearly as the number of the game out of the 82 game regular season increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "A second and more robust iteration seeks to support the hypothesis that the value of a win or loss does not scale linearly throughout the NBA regular season. Moreover, even if the value of a win or loss is not to scale linearly but in some other fashion, there is an argument to be made that the value of a win or loss at game $g$ does not necessarily have to be greater than that of the same outcome at any time $g-1$ in the past. Put simply, the number of a game in the regular season has a varying degree of impact on a teams momentum depending on when during the season the game occurs. The basis for this hypothesis is rooted in the following logic. To start, games at the end of the NBA season have a greater impact than other games, especially for those teams that are in bunched up rankings to crack the playoffs or fighting for seeding. Additionally, games at the beginning of the season might have a greater impact than other games given that this is when a team can really set the tone and get started on the right footing. On the other hand, there's most likely a mid-season lull around the all-star break, where winning is still important but doesn't have the same boost to a team's morale or confidence when compared to the early and late stages of an NBA season. \n",
    "\n",
    "With all this in mind, the parameter construction needs to capture the dynamics of how important the $g^{th}$ game into the NBA season is for a team's momentum. I I approached this task through the lens of fourier analysis, performing a rudimentary decomposition on the theoretical importance of different game numbers $g$ on a teams momentum with three different functions. Fourier analysis is the study of how simple trigonometric functions can be used to model or estimate more complex general functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, I wanted to model the dynamics of a game's impact using just one function. Taking the aformentioned logic, I start by taking an 82 game NBA season and dividing it into quarters, essentially identify four points during the season where momentum might change. Since 82 isn't perfectly divisible by 4, the final values come out to 23, 41, 62, and 82. From there, we can look at an NBA season as an aggregation of periods between these points. The first period, from the start of the season to game 23 is critical for a team to get off on the right foot, with games increasing in importance up until that point. In building the model, game 23 becomes a local maxima in the smoothing parameter function. However, from there, games 23 through 41 slowly decrease in importance with games becoming less critical to a team's momentum which leads game 41 to become a local minima. Finally, the rest of the games continue to grow in importance until the end of the season, game 82, which means that the function continuously increases from 41 to 82. With all this in mind, I construct a cubic function with a derivative with roots at 23 and 41 with dynamics that follow: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f'(g) = (x - 23)(x - 41) \\rightarrow x^2 - 41x + - 23x + 943 \\rightarrow x^2 - 64x + 943 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is the derivative of the actual game-adjusting smoothing parameter since I'm looking to create a local maxima at 23 and a local minima at 41. Therefore, the actual smoothing parameter is the integral of this function as the derivative will have roots of zero at the local maxima and minima. Integrating the function gives us the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(g) = \\int_1^{82} \\! x^2 - 64x + 943 \\, \\mathrm{d}x \\rightarrow \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{64x^2}{2} + 943x + c$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The integral of $f'(g)$ is the final function to model the time-varying dynamics of how important the game number is on a team's momentum. However, the scaling of this function tends to disproportionately favor games later on into the season over all others, and therefore I took the log of this function to scale its impact. I also subtract 2.4 from any output of the function in order to scale it with the second term in the smoothing paramter. Thus, the finalized version of the first component to the smoothing parameter is as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\gamma_{1}(g) = \\log \\left( \\frac{g^3}{3} - \\frac{64g^2}{2} + 943g \\right) - 2.4 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function 2\n",
    "\n",
    "A second term is needed in capturing what I believe to be the true time-varying impact of a game number on a team's momentum in order to better account for amplitude between maxima and minima. The term from function 1 does discriminate in assigning value to games appropriately, but to some extent I feel the impact i not as pronounced as it should be. Additionally, the local minima at the midpoint of the season is still worth more of an impact compared to the first few games of the season which I'd argue are more important to a team to get off on the right foot. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is where a trigonometric function can help, and also where actual fourier analysis comes into play. The $\\sin$ and $\\cos$ functions both model the wavelike movement that I am looking for in constructing this parameter. The two biggest catches are the need for all y-values to remain positive and for the period to occur such that $f'(g)$ would have zeros at the desired 23rd and 41st games. This led me to start off with modeling the impact of the game number through the following function: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(g) = 2\\pi \\times \\frac{|g - 41|}{41} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This function produces a v-shaped graph where there is a nondifferentiable zero at game 41. However, this produce an output where the games at the start and end of the season are of the most importance and all other games decline in relative value. I then transitioned this function into a trigonometric function that produces the wave-like output that is needed to better capture the time-varying impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(g) = -\\cos\\left(2\\pi \\times \\frac{|g - 41|}{41}\\right) \\times + 5.85 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The cosine function best produces the peaks and troughs that coordinate with where the importance of games should occur. I invert the function by multiplying it by negative 1 so that the value of games increases up until the zeros that I'm most concerned with (25, 41). The final addition of 5.86 to the output of the function scales this for better combination with the functions 1 and 3; the goal is to create a cohesive smoothing parameter. This leaves us the final $\\gamma_{2}(g)$ equation to combine in a piecewise smoothing parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\gamma_{2}(g) = -\\cos\\left(2\\pi \\times \\frac{|g - 41|}{41}\\right) + 5.85 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this last function is necessary in accounting for the fact that games at the season should have the most impact on a team's momentum. For that matter, I consider wins and losses in the final quarter of the NBA season to be \"sticky\" on a team's morale and confidence. Late season wins can give a team that extra push necessary to battle through a first round series whereas a late season slump can be just detrimental enough to push a team out of form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function 3 in the piecewise function is a transformation of function 1. My initial problem with using just function 1 to model the impact of the game number $g$ in a season was the lack of variation in the amplitude of the function for all $g$ between 1 and 82, inclusive. After applying the cosine function to vary the importance of games during the mid-season stretch, I transform the original cubic function to increase the steepness of the curve from games 62 onward. This allows for the weight of games at the end of the season to be more than at any other point. But, with the use of a piecewise function I can still weight games at the beginning of the season greater than those in the middle. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\gamma_{3}(g) = \\sqrt{\\left[ \\log \\left( \\frac{g^3}{3} - \\frac{64g^2}{2} + 943g \\right) - 2.4 \\right]^{\\left(1.2 + \\frac{g}{82}\\right)}} $$\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Smoothing Parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "These two functions $\\gamma_1(g)$ and $\\gamma_2(g)$ are then combined to create the piecewise function which I use to model the time-varying impact of a game on a team's momentum. The finalized smoothing parameter is labeled as $\\gamma$ and it is a function dependent on the input variable $(g)$. One important callout is the adjustment of where I initially wanted to place the zeros. In the function below you can see the conditions to switch between the different $\\gamma$ are at 25 and 61, not at the initial 23 like I had imagined. The derivative of function 1 approaches zero in the range where the derivative of function 2 also approaches zero. The overlap here provides some flexibility in where the switch occurs, and the smoothest transition happens when $g = 25$.\n",

    "Not all wins are created equal. To borrow from college basketball, a 16-seed University of Marlyland Baltimore College (UMBC) beating a 1-seed University of Virginia (UVA) is ***not*** the same if the 1-seed UVA were to have defeated the 16-seed UMBC. March Madness might not be the best example to borrow from since the tournament is single elimination, but the concept of a much better team beating a worse team and vice versa is something generalizable across all sports. For the NBA, if you are a team already at the top of your conference standings and you blow-out a team that's tanking for draft picks, that win should not count as much towards your moment compared to if you were a team that's fighting for a play-off spot and manages to take out a current top-3 seed. \n",
    "\n",
    "All this goes to say that the fault of the original model lies in its simplicity in failing to incorporate strength of opponent in a win or loss. This is a crucial piece of information to add. First, it gives us another degree of differentiation in performances as now we can say certain wins and losses should have greater impact based upon the opponent. But secondly, it provides an opportunity for teams to interact with one another directly in their momentum. The prior model had no unique component where the variable was based on the opponent, everything was game dependent. Now, having an opponent specific term allows us to see how momentum changes with interactions with other vying contenders.\n",

    "This parameter is much simpler in comparison to the dynamic game-smoothing parameter. The main input into this parameter is represented by the character $\\rho_g$ which is just the opponents win percentage at game $g$. The first of the two functions in the piecewise equation above is in the case where a team loses. The equation is bounded between 1 and 6, where teams with worse records will produce higher values in the model. This is important insofar as the condition for the use of this part of the piecewise equation is a lose (represented by the negative point differential). This allows for loses to teams with worse records to have a greater negative impact on a teams momentum compared to losing to a top ranked team. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second of the two equations operates in a very similar manner, just with the opposite intention. By taking the difference between 1 and the team's winning percentage, the denominator becomes smaller for the better record a team might have. Outputs for this function for all $g$ between 1 and 82 are also bounded between 1 and 6 but scale in the opposite direction where a better record produces a higher output. This is then multiplied in cases of positive point differentials which represent wins. A win against a good team therefore has a greater and more impactful effect on a team's momentum compared to beatdowns on bad teams. \n",
    "\n",
    "The one main drawback in applying this parameter is that it will be noisy, especially at the start of the season. When records are made up of only a handful of games win-percentages change rapidly and dramatically. Additionally, when a team has one 100% of their games, this warrants the need for the min and max arguments in the model construction. Having a value of 100% for a win-percentage will produce infinite values in parameter construction so the maximization constraint is added to the denominator of the second function. The maximization constraint is applied in the first function as cases where a team has no wins (i.e., a win percentage of 0) would produced undefined $\\omega_W$.\n",

In my attempt to improve the comprehension of this model, I'm looking to add in features that better capture aspects of confidence asies from the actual outcome of the game. For that matter, I come to question of **are there elements of in-game play that matter for momentum independent of the result of the game?** \n",

    "One of the more obvious proxies for confidence that one could capture from the box-score would be a players shooting. The hot-hand fallacy in shooting comes from the idea that a player takes more shots when they see their prior attempts go down; it's a positive feedback loop. It can be safely argued that taking more shots and making them are elements of a winning basketball team. A shooter shoots. Those who don't even want to take shots in the first place are putting themselves at a disadvantage relative to other players by limiting their opportunities to quite literally get buckets. If a whole team shoots the ball poorly on a given night, are they going to suffer from the safe blow to their confidence moving forward? Or, if a team shoots the ball really well but still loses, will their confidence take less of a hit than it would've if they shot the ball poorly and lost?

By taking the difference from 1 and putting this in the denominator, we're able to inflate the value of $\\theta$ for teams that shoot the ball really well. Putting the total number of makes in the numerator also allows this value to scale with simply making more threes. This allows the value of $\\theta$ to reward both efficiency *and* volume. In that vein, I constructed this parameter with the intent of avoiding inflating shooting performances that are highly efficient but low in volume. \n",

But after adjusting the complementing parameters, the point differential has an oversided impact on team momentum. A 20-point win could be considered a blowout, but in some cases this factor will be 2-3 times larger than any other parameter in the model. If terms are to be multiplied together, then this will distort the final value for $m$ and $M$. \n",
